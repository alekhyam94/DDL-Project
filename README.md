# DDL-Project
This repository is being maintained by project Team 6 from DDL course (CS 8803), Georgia Tech. We are working on Video Understading wherein given a video, we would like to predict multiple labels/categories/tags for each video. With an increase in generation and consumption of videos, efficient retrieval of videos has become a challenging task. By providing multiple labels/categories to each video, we hope to develop a better video understanding, as a step towards solving this problem. 

Our directory structure is as follows:
- code:
  - NetDissect: Contains files for Network Dissection along with README.
  - youtube8m: Contains files for YouTube 8M Starter Code along with README.
  - Starter_Explore_sample_data.ipynb: Code for data exploration and pre-processing. The sample data and files needed for running should be downloaded in ../sample_input and can be accessed here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e_moD2WWSDyKC4LBpP_ta9ctUoVAN4La?usp=sharing  
- docs: Contains project proposal, progress reports and presentation.
